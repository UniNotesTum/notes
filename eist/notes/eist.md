__Decomposition__ - slice a problem into small pieces: "divide and conquer". You
can either decompose using the functional model or you can focus on classes
using the object-oriented programming.

__Abstraction__ - "focus and ignore"

__Hierarchy__ - relationships between classes, like inheritance and aggregation.

## UML

An empty diamond means consists of.

We use a star, when something consists of many things. It's like (min, max)
notation, but only with the top constraint.

__Taxonomy?__ - either or

A __system__ is an organized set of communicating parts. __Subsystems__ are a
part of the bigger system. lie jet engine is a part of a plane.

__Model__ is an abstraction describing a system.

__View__ depicts selected aspects of a model.

__"Napkin" notation__

__UML notation__ it's a lot more clear than the previous one, it's a class
notation.

If I have an underlined name, it means it's an instance of some class.

Use case diagrams.

__Composition__ is described as a filled out diamond. Building is composed of
rooms. And without a building a room cannot exist.

### Visual Paradigm

When we copy paste a class or an object we actually get a reference on the old
and not a new one.
